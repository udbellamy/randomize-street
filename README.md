# randomize-street

Fill the characters file with the characters you own, then launch the script.
There's an arbitrary number of costumes, I didn't want to create and maintain a database of each characters number of costumes. If I get Costume 13 for a character that only have 10, I go 10 costumes to the right, 3 to the left. Do want you want ;)
